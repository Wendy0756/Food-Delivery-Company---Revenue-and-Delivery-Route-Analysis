    "# Customer Value Evaluation under the RFM Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Recency - Customers' scores from the recency perspective is calculated from the average number of days since their last 3 purchases to our study date. Holidays need to be excluded from the count due to inevitable store close. A smaller number of days leads to higher recency score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency - Frequency is measured by the rate of number of purchases of each type of food made by each customer over the total purchase amount within a non-holiday month. A relatively long period is chosen to rule out the impact of short term perference. Customers' royalty towards food varies based on their tastes, so we need to evaluate the frequency score by food type as well. The ratio standardizes data and measures the importance of each customer to each type of food. A higher ratio means higher frequency score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monetary Value - A Customer's monetary value is measured by his/her total money spent on a food in a year over the total annual sales dollar amount of that food. The annual spending of a customer can be calculated by annualizing (times 10) the sales of a random non-holiday month, plus the sales of the two holiday months. Higher annual spending means higher monetary value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synthesis - Valuable customers should win either top 5% score in one single category or top 5% weighted average score among the three dimensions. To calculate a weighted average scores, the weights are assigned 20% to Recency, 40% to Frequency, and 40% to monetary value. A high recency score points out the potential of the customer. A high frequency score indicates the royalty of the customer. A high monetary score directly reflects the customer's value to our store. In addition to the numerical analysis, we will also plot out the customers' visit frequency and money spent, to explore if any pattern exists. Customer behavior pattern might open up doors to new business opportunties.  "
